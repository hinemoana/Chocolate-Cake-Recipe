STEP 1
Preheat oven to 180Â°C bake. Grease and line a high-sided 20cm round cake tin.

STEP 2
Mix together the Edmonds Standard Grade Flour, cocoa, Edmonds Baking Powder and Chelsea White Sugar. 

STEP 3
In separate bowl, melt the Tararua Butter and Chelsea Golden Syrup together (about 1 minute on high in the microwave usually does it). 

STEP 4
In another bowl whisk the eggs, then whisk in the Meadow Fresh Original Milk, Edmonds Baking Soda and vanilla. Add both the butter mix and the egg/milk mix to dry ingredients and beat on medium for 1 minute.

STEP 5
Spoon into prepared tin and level the surface. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake bounces back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in tin for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 

STEP 6
Icing:
Place all icing ingredients in a medium bowl. Beat on low to combine, then increase speed to high and beat until smooth and creamy. Spread onto cooled cake.
